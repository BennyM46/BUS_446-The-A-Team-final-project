Swings and Strikes: Analyzing Hitting and Pitching Performance in Baseball
This analysis examines the most important hitting and pitching statistics in Major League Baseball by applying regression methods including R² values and p-tests to determine which metrics best predict team win percentage. Measures such as OPS, SLG, AVG, WHIP, BAA, and various strikeout and walk rates were assessed. Results indicate that OPS is the strongest hitting predictor, driven primarily by slugging percentage rather than batting average. On the pitching side, WHIP was the most influential variable, with batting average against (BAA) also showing meaningful significance. An A/B-style comparison of teams with exceptionally strong hitting versus those with dominant pitching revealed no statistically significant difference in win percentage, suggesting a natural balance between offensive and defensive strengths. Overall, the findings imply that hitters gain the most by prioritizing power while maintaining plate discipline, and that successful MLB teams typically rely on a well-rounded blend of both hitting and pitching rather than one dimension alone.
